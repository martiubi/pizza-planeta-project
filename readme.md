# PIZZA PLANETA WEBSITE

My favorite pizza place has this very very badlooking website where they update daily their promotion prices. One day while watching a _[JavaScript projects tutorial](doc:https://youtu.be/3PHXvlpOkf4)_ video on YouTube I decided that maybe I could try an do something better using some of the things I was learning. That's when I started this project (my first, my own) without telling anyone. I know it's very basic but it was fun. I'm going to show this website to Pizza Planeta this week. I hope they like it and give me free pizza.

This is the website they use: www.pizzaplaneta.com.ar.

This is the website I developed: https://pizza-planeta-project.vercel.app/.

I hope you like it, next time I will be better.
